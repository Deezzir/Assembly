# Assembly Language
This repository contains three simple loop programs written for  x86_64 and AArch64 platforms. This is start of my assembly journey. 

## x86_64
The x86_64 folder contains assembly code that uses [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/xdoc/2.11/html/nasmdoc1.html#section-1.1) syntax and Makefile for compiling all the files into executables.

## AArch64
The aarch64 folder contains assembly code which compiles under [GNU Assembler (gas/as)](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/)
